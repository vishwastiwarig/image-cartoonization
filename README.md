# README for Image Cartoonization Project

## Overview

This project implements an image cartoonization technique using Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy. The goal is to transform real images into cartoon-like representations, making use of various image processing techniques.

## Features

- **Image Loading**: Read and display images using OpenCV.
- **Cartoon Effect**: Apply a cartoon effect to images through edge detection and color quantization.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to visualize the original and cartoonized images side by side.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:
